Have you ever wondered that if you have a personal desktop assistant which reduces your work and automated to perform the tasks.
I have worked on this Jarvis Project and developed this to perform certain tasks like sending an email, playing music, and searching wikipedia for me.
This is a basic code that every one can understand and this is a typical prototype that everyone can create.

Important modules that should be needed priorly are:
1) pyttsx3 : "pip install pyttsx3"
2) speech_recognition : "pip install speech_recognition"
3) wikipedia : "pip install wikipedia"
4) Web Browser : "pip istall webbrowser"
5) smtplib : "pip install smtplib"
6) pyaudio : "pip install pyaudio"
7) setupTools : "pip install setupTools"

For the working of pyaudio we need to install the modules from third parties like wheel: "pip install wheel" we need to run this in the windows powershell.
Some doesn't have wheel module too, for that we need to install pywin32 module : "pip install pywin32"

These are the improtant modules that everyone should have if you think of tho do the project.
